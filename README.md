# Fall Intern Project

## 📖 Overview

The Fall Intern project is a research assistant tool that utilizes the power of various libraries like streamlit, BeautifulSoup, requests, and FastAPI to fetch, scrape, and summarize web content based on user queries. It provides an interactive web application to conduct research on user-defined topics.

## 🚀 Features

- **Research Goal Input:** Input your research goals or questions and get detailed information on the topic.
- **Web Scraping:** Uses BeautifulSoup to scrape websites.
- **Information Summarization:** If the content is vast, it summarizes the content to give a concise overview.
- **Web Application:** A simple yet powerful web application interface using Streamlit.
- **API Endpoint:** A FastAPI endpoint to get research content programmatically.

## 🔧 Setup

### Prerequisites:
- Python installed on your machine.
- API keys for browserless and serper.

### Steps:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up a virtual environment and install the required libraries using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit BeautifulSoup4 requests fastapi
   ```
3. Set your API keys in the .env file:
   ```env
   BROWSERLESS_API_KEY=your_browserless_api_key
   SERPER_API_KEY=your_serper_api_key
   ```
4. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run your_script_name.py
   ```
5. To run the FastAPI endpoint, uncomment the FastAPI section in the script and then:
   ```bash
   uvicorn your_script_name:app --reload
   ```

## 💻 Usage

### Web Application:
1. Navigate to the Streamlit application in your browser.
2. Enter your research goal or topic in the input box.
3. Wait for the operation to complete.
4. View the summarized research content based on your query.

### FastAPI Endpoint:
- Make a POST request with your research query in the following format:
  ```json
  {
      "query": "Your research topic or question here"
  }
  ```
  The API will return the summarized content of your research topic.

## ⚠️ Notes

- The scraping functionality is designed to work with certain websites. It may not work with sites that have dynamic content rendered via JavaScript unless integrated with solutions like browserless.
- Always respect the terms of service of any website you scrape. Some websites may prohibit scraping or have limitations on access.
